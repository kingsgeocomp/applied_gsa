But what defines similarity and difference? There is no _one_ answer to that question and so there are many different ways to cluster data, each of which has strengths and weaknesses that make them more, or less, appropriate in different contexts."

    "\n",
    "The most commonly-used _aspatial_ clustering algorighms are all found in [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), so that will be the focus of this practical. But just as there are aspatial and spatial statistics, there are also _spatially-aware_ clustering algorithms to be found in [PySAL](http://pysal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), the Python Spatial Analysis Library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clustering in sklearn\n",
    "\n",
    "One organisation recently produced a handy scikit-learn cheatsheet that you should [download](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/Scikit_Learn_Cheat_Sheet_Python.pdf). The terminology used in scikit-learn is rather different from anything you will have encountered before (unless you've studied computer science and, possibly, statistics) so it's worth spending a few minutes mapping what you already know on to the sklearn framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "  | Continuous | Categorical\n",
    "- | ---------- | -----------\n",
    "**Supervised** | Regression | Classification\n",
    "**Unsupervised** | Dimensionality Reduction | Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "So clustering is a form of unsupervised (because we don't train the model on what a 'good' result looks like) and categorical (because we get labels out of the model, not predictors) machine learning. Clustering is often used together with PCI (Principal Components Analysis) which is a form of unsupervised dimensionality reduction: data sets with \"high dimensionality\" are reduced using PCI (you can think of this as a realignment of the axes with the 'data cloud') which has the effect of _maximising the variance_ on each new axis, and the reduced-dimension dataset is then fed to a clustering algorithm. Similarly, supervised approaches are often paired: logistic regression (supervised) is often used with classification (supervised).\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, here's a map to sklearn's algorithms and how to navigate them:\n",
    "\n",
    "<a href=\"http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/\"><img alt=\"SciKit-Learn Algorithm Map\" src=\"http://scikit-learn.org/stable/_static/ml_map.png\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clustering in PySAL\n",
    "\n",
    "PySAL is similarly complex and _also_ has a map to help you navigate its complexities -- in this case we're particularly interested in the orange 'branch' of PySAL (labelled clustering!):\n",
    "\n",
    "![PySAL Map](http://darribas.org/gds_scipy16/content/figs/pysal.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Which Approach is Right?\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason that there is no 'right' approach (as I said above) is that it all depends on what you're trying to accomplish and how you're _reasoning_ about your problem. The image below highlights the extent to which the different clustering approaches in sklearn can produce different results -- and this is only for the _non-geographic_ algorithms!\n",
    "\n",
    "<a href=\"http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#clustering\"><img alt=\"Clustering algorithm comparison\" src=\"http://scikit-learn.org/stable/_images/sphx_glr_plot_cluster_comparison_0011.png\" /></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "To think about this in a little more detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If I run an online company and I want to classify my customers on the basis of their product purchases, then I probably don't care much about where they are, only about what they buy. So my clustering approach doesn't need to take geography into account. I might well _discover_ that many of my most valuable customers live in a few areas, but that is a finding, not a factor, in my research.\n",
    "* Conversely, if I am looking for cancer clusters then I might well care a _lot_ about geography because I want to make sure that I don't overlook a bigger cluster because it's 'hidden' inside an area with lots of non-sufferers. In that case, I want my clusters to take geography into account because I'm looking for agglomerations. That approach might classify an area with a smaller proportion of cancer patients as part of a 'cancer cluster' but that's because it is still significant _because_ of the geography.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you can undertake a spatial analysis using _either_ approach, it just depends on the role that you think geography should play in producing the clusters in the first place. We'll see this in action today!"

    "The _Geocomputation_ handbook suggests that normalisation via log or Box-Cox transformation happens _after_ the variables have been converted to percentages, so that's what I've done here. I think that this approach is debatable as it's potentially harder to deal with zeroes in the data _after_ converting to a percentage than it was before. The reason that zeroes are an issue is that the log of 0.0 is `-Inf` or `NaN`, so this blows up in your cluster analysis if you don't deal with it now. The easiest way to do this is to simply add `1` to every raw count, ensuring that the smallest value in your data set is always positive. If you had already converted to a percentage then adding 0.000001% to only the zero values still changes the actual distribution, while adding 0.000001% to all values could leave you with percentages over 100!\n",

    "### Why Standardise\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main challenges of clustering, however, is that the scale of each dimension matters: if you were to try to cluster, for example, [1] how many metres per year a glacier moved with [2] the number of cubic metres by which it grew, then you would only be clustering on variable [2]. \n",
    "\n",
    "That's because glaciers contain millions of cubic metres of ice and will grow or shrink by thousands of cubic metres each year. In contrast, most glaciers move at most a few metres per year. So the sheer scale difference between these two dimensions means that the values of variable 1 dominate the clustering algorithm because they provide a much better 'spread' in the data than variable 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this we need to standardise the data in some way so that the scales are relatively consistent. There's no _one_ way to standardise the data, it depends on the characteristics of the data _as well as_ what we're looking for in terms of clustering. As a general rule, we're _aiming_ for a normal (a.k.a. Gaussian) distribution with 0 mean and unit variance. The latter part of this is what most people focus on: you may recall our work with transformations last year, and here's one more reason why it's useful. That said, normalisation (making the data 'look' normal) can also be very important for the process since it can significantly skew the results as well if the data itself is heavily skewed.\n",

The idea is that you plot the average WCSS for each number of possible clusters in the range of interest (`2...n`) and then look for a 'knee' (i.e. kink) in the curve. The principle of this approach is that you look for the point where there is declining benefit from adding more clusters.
